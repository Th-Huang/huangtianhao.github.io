I am a Ph.D. candidate at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, focusing on visual inspection technologies. My research bridges the gap between computer vision (including DIC for strain measurement and point cloud processing) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA), advancing the frontiers of experimental and computational mechanics.
